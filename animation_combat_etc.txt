Combat moves:
	Switch to combat stance - change from char looking in walking direction to char facing same direction char was in 
				  when switching to combat stance and can switch facing direction with button press
	Switch facing direction - only in combat stance
	Dash 			- move forward a few steps very quickly, but using a lot of stamina in the process; allows char to move through
				  hostile entities, but doesn't generate invincibility frames (meaning char can still be hit in the process)
	Dodge			- Quickly move back a step, using a bit of stamina; doesn't create invincibility frames
	Block			- Makes char immoble for a few frames and has short cooldown (can't be spammed for invincibility), but generates
				  invincibility frames and hostile entities attacking the char while blocking are thrown back and stunned
	Attack			- Very slight cooldown, uses a bit of stamina; unless blocked or parried this damages hostile entities
	


Other combat mechanics:
	*Slower walkspeed
	*Jumpheight reduced
	*(Potentially) with the exception of special attack, if an entity and the player hit each other with an attack at the same time, both
	 are thrown back a bit and stunned for a second or two
	*Entities have attack patterns, which also have cooldowns, so that the player has to act before the entity is able to attack again
